1. Add architecture docs as they're implemented
   - Tech stack reasoning
   - Real-time strategy
   - Authentication design
2. Document first challenges & solutions
3. Keep development logs current
4. Update data models as schema evolves

MEDIUM-TERM (Next 3 months):
1. Complete all architecture docs
2. Add 10+ development log entries
3. Document 5+ challenges overcome
4. Polish for potential blog publishing

LONG-TERM (Future):
1. Convert documentation to blog posts
2. Create video walkthroughs
3. Maintain as project evolves
4. Expand as project grows

================================================================================
SUCCESS METRICS
================================================================================

This documentation system succeeds if:

✓ New team member ramps up in 1 week (not 1 month)
✓ Decisions are logged and traceable
✓ Failures are documented
✓ Can explain project to investors in 10 minutes
✓ Can teach concepts in blog format
✓ Reduces repeated questions
✓ Shows project maturity

Status: On track for all metrics.

================================================================================
CONCLUSION
================================================================================

Health Intel now has a comprehensive documentation system that:

1. Documents the VISION (why this matters)
2. Documents the STRATEGY (how it works at scale)
3. Documents the MVP (what we're building first)
4. Documents the ARCHITECTURE (how it's built)
5. Provides TEMPLATES for ongoing documentation
6. Explains HOW TO CONTRIBUTE

This is not just documentation. This is institutional memory.
It will pay dividends as the project grows.
