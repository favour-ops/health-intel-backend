✅ **Linked** - Cross-references between docs  
✅ **Maintainable** - Templates make updates easy  
✅ **Searchable** - Clear headings and sections

## 🚀 How to Use This System

### Getting Oriented

1. **Start with [QUICK_START.md](./QUICK_START.md)** (10 min)
   - What is Health Intel?
   - Why it matters
   - Current status

2. **Read [Vision & Strategy](./docs/01-vision-and-strategy/)** (30 min)
   - Understand the problem
   - See the business model
   - Know the adoption plan

3. **Understand [MVP Definition](./docs/02-mvp-definition/)** (20 min)
   - What's in v0.1
   - What's explicitly out of scope
   - Success criteria

### Building Features

1. Check [MVP Definition](./docs/02-mvp-definition/) for scope
2. Reference [Architecture](./docs/03-architecture/) for patterns
3. Check [Data Models](./docs/06-data-models/) for schema
4. Add to [Development Logs](./docs/04-development-logs/) when done

### Hitting Obstacles

1. Check [Challenges & Solutions](./docs/05-challenges-and-solutions/)
2. Search related docs
3. Document your solution (help the next person)

### Understanding Decisions

1. Check relevant section (Vision, Architecture, MVP)
2. Read the reasoning
3. Find linked references

## 💡 Key Features of This System

### 1. Multiple Entry Points
- **For PMs:** Vision & Strategy
- **For Developers:** Architecture & MVP
- **For Investors:** Problem Statement & Value Creation
- **For Everyone:** Quick Start

### 2. Progressive Detail
Each section has:
- Quick overview (README)
- Detailed documents
- Deep-dive articles

Start anywhere, go deeper as needed.

### 3. Templates for Ongoing Work
Every major documentation task has a template:
- Development logs
- Challenges & solutions
- Data models
- Architecture decisions

Makes regular documentation easy.

### 4. Built-In Navigation
- Table of contents in each section
- Cross-references between docs
- Quick reference guides
- Role-based reading paths

### 5. Blog-Ready Format
Each doc is written to:
- Stand alone if published
- Work with related docs
- Explain for outsiders
- Tell the story

Can easily become blog posts later.

---

## 📈 How This System Grows

### Weekly
- Add development log entry (what was built)
- Update current status in QUICK_START
- Add to DOCUMENTATION_INDEX progress

### Monthly
- Document architectural decisions (if made)
- Add to challenges & solutions (problems solved)
- Review and update data models (if schema changed)

### Quarterly
- Polish vision section (if strategy evolved)
- Review and update MVP definition (if scope changed)
- Consider converting docs to blog posts

---

## 🎯 Success Metrics

This documentation system succeeds if:

✅ **New team member can ramp up in 1 week** (instead of 1 month)  
✅ **Decisions are logged and traceable** (why this choice?)  
✅ **Failures are documented** (don't repeat them)  
✅ **Can explain to investors in 10 minutes** (clear narrative)  
✅ **Can teach in a blog** (good explanations)  
✅ **Reduces repeated questions** (find it in docs)  
✅ **Shows project maturity** (professional approach)

## 📝 Maintenance

This system stays alive if:

1. **Development logs updated regularly** (weekly)
2. **New challenges documented** (as they arise)
3. **Data models kept current** (with schema)
4. **README updated with status** (biweekly)
5. **Links work** (check quarterly)

It takes **~30 minutes/week** to keep current.

Worth it? Absolutely. It becomes your project's institutional memory.

---

**Status:** ✅ Foundation Complete  
**Next:** Start adding development logs & challenges as work progresses  
**Timeline:** Growing document by document, log by log

---

Remember: **Good documentation is not a luxury. It's infrastructure.**

This project respects that. Keep it maintained. It'll pay dividends.
